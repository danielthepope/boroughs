Tap somewhere on the map or use your device's location.

# Datasources
- London_Boroughs.gpkg is from https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london_boroughs, and is free to use. Open Government Licence v3.0
- london_boroughs.geojson was converted from the GeoPackage format using https://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-js/
- london_boroughs_encoded.json uses some Google magic because the file size is <10% of the GeoJSON data. It was converted with help from the function inside helpers.js
- The CSV files in public/data/postcodes are adapted from the CSV file downloaded from https://www.getthedata.com/open-postcode-geo-london but filtered using filter_postcodes.py. They're generated by running `./scripts/filter_postcodes.py path/to/open_postcode_geo_london.csv public/data/postcodes`
